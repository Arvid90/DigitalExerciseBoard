# DigitalExerciseBoard
This is the software for a digital exercise board that was made in a collaboration between
Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset and two students at KTH.
It is intended to help patients at Tema Cancer, Urologen by tracking 
their daily exercises as part of the ERAS perioperative pathway.
